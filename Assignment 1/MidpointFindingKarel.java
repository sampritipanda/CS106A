 * -------------------------------
 * When you finish writing it, the MidpointFindingKarel class should
 * leave a beeper on the corner closest to the center of 1st Street
 * (or either of the two central corners if 1st Street has an even
 * number of corners).  Karel can put down additional beepers as it
 * looks for the midpoint, but must pick them up again before it
 * stops.  The world may be of any size, but you are allowed to
 * assume that it is at least as tall as it is wide.
